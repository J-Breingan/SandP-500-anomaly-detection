# SandP-500-anomaly-detection
Using LSTM NNs to detect anomalies within financial data

Using S&P 500 data from 1986 to 2018, we search for anomalies where closing prices suddenly changed in ways not indicated by the dominant trends of the time.

Original code written in Coursera's Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data with Keras Guided Project.
